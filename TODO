FIX:

-	rpmlint spec files

-	rpmlint binary rpm files

-	Chapter 6 glibc locale generation
	- add note to run /sbin/locale-gen.sh on first login new system

-	Rpm database needs rebuilt on newly built system
	-	rpmdb --rebuilddb fixes this for now
	
-	executables and libraries are not stripped even when /tools/bin/strip
	is run when building rpm package.
	
-	New version rpm is out

-	Create split packages ie devel rpms for includes and static libs
